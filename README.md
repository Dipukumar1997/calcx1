# 🌐 Zenforce

> ⚠️ **Experimental Zone – Enter at Your Own Risk! 😄**

Zenforce is a **non-functional** (but beautiful) experimental website I created for the sole purpose of **learning** and breaking things until they make sense. It's my testing ground for everything from **CSS struggles** to **NoSQL headaches**, and even a slightly ambitious **JWT-based authentication** setup.

- 🔐 JWT-based Authentication

## 🧪 Disclaimer

This website is **not meant to be used seriously** (unless you enjoy 404s and unexpected behaviors).  
Feel free to explore if you're curious — but if you're expecting a production-grade app, I strongly suggest you...

> _Go check out my other repos instead_ 😅

## 🏁 Final Note

Zenforce is now retired, but it proudly lives on as a **trophy of learning**  
and a reminder that **every broken button once taught me something**.
